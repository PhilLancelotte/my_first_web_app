<B>Ten</b> the automatic countdown started it’s final moments
“I really do hope that you packed the sunscreen Roger?”
“What? This is a mission to space, we’re not heading to Spain Dave”
“I know it’s not Spain, we’re heading for Oz.”

<B>Nine</b> 
“You are onboard ‘IPSS Visionary’ an ‘Eagle 10 Sub-Light Planet Searcher’ Space Ship, we are definitely heading off planet”
“Yeah, but then when we come back down we’ll be going to Oz.”
“This is a one way trip Dave, we are not coming back. ”

<B>Eight</b> 
“I know we are not coming back to where we take off from, this rocket won’t land in Ramsgate.”
“Dave, we are heading to Mars to drop of colonists, then we’re doing a bit of a gravitational sling-shot around Jupiter into the ion cloud”

<B>Seven</b>
Dave ignored all this, “The sunscreen Roger, is it in your bag, ‘cos it’s not in mine?”
Roger continued... “After the sling-shot we head through the Kuiper belt and out towards Neptune, it’ll take six months at maximum thrust to get there, that’s when we get our mission orders.”

<B>Six</b> 
“Mission orders?” Queried Dave.
“Yes, mission orders. This is not just a colony ship, we are planet hunters, our ultimate job is to search for new worlds and put a small team there ready for when the colonists arrive, we are soldiers, engineers and scientists.”
“Oh, so no sunbathing then?” Dave had gone white as a sheet.

<B>Five</b>
“What is your occupation Dave? Are you a mission specialist?” Roger was certain he knew the answer to the second part of that question before he asked it.
“Erm, I’m an apprentice hairdresser, I’m really good, everyone needs a hairdresser.”

<B>Four</b>
Roger quickly took his helmet off to reveal a closely shaved head “Do I look like I need a hairdresser Dave? How long have you been in Ramsgate Starcity? What training have you had?”
“I’ve been here 3 weeks, My training was completed.” Dave replied.
“They told you that?” 
“Well, they told me that I didn’t need to go anymore as there was nothing they could teach me.” 

<B>Three</b>
“Ramsgate, we have a problem” these were the first 5 words that Roger spoke to mission control, he continued “I think my number two is not as prepared as he might be for what is about to happen.”

<B>Two</b>
“This is mission control, yeah, err, we’re sorry about that, it would appear that we mixed up your Dave with another Dave, the one you have is supposed to board a scram jet rocket test flight bound for Oz, he spectacularly failed the testing and he’s been given a job as cabin crew with BrianAir.”

<B>One</b> 
“OK, understood, can we pause countdown and maybe get him evacuated off this vessel before it becomes a problem for the Missi...

<b>Blast Off</b> of the Eagle 10 Colony builder rocket, bound for mars and beyond, may your god’s go with you....” Mission control signed off. 

Dave was Roger’s problem now.
