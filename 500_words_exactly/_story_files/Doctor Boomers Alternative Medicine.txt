Once upon a time in the sleepy town of Boogerville, Dr. Boomer was known for his eccentric yet effective medical treatments. 
Among his most peculiar remedies was a creation that raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity throughout the community

Dr. Boomer, an elderly physician with a white beard and a twinkle in his eye, had spent decades experimenting with unconventional solutions to common ailments. His small clinic, nestled between a bakery and a flower shop, held the secret to his latest invention — Dr. Boomer's Candles.

These candles were amazing, a patient would be prescribed 3 candles over the course of 3 weeks, but by the end of the first week, they were always cured. They never collected the second or third candle from the chemist, and indeed, never returned to Dr. Boomer for any other condition. They were cured for life.

Word of Dr. Boomer's amazing candles spread from town to town, and his waiting room was always full with people wanting a cure for conditions ranging from a runny nose to a persistent cough or severe flatulence, one man even came in to see Dr. Boomer about a mark on his face, it just wouldn’t go away. 
That one turned out to be dirty glasses that just needed a bit of a wipe. 

Now, you might think that a medicinal candle would be pretty and fragrant and calming, but these candles were different, you see they were generally smelly and disgusting and ugly looking, but this wasn’t the disturbing part, the thing that would make you want to shut your eyes and cover your ears while shouting “La, La, La.” to yourself would be the way he made the candles.

The thing is, Dr. Boomer had a peculiar way of getting the wax to make the candles, normally, the way of getting wax to make candles is either to steal it from any bees that might be nearby or make it from plants. 

Dr Boomer got it from his ears, every morning when he woke he would have an extremely plentiful supply of ear wax ready to be harvested from his considerably large lug holes, he would do exactly the same before he went to bed, ensuring he had enough molten wax ready to pour in the small moulds he kept in his bedside draw

He would scoop it out with a little spoon and drop it into a small metal vat that was bubbling away on his bedside table. As he let the globule of wax fall into the revolting molten pool, you could hear a “Plop!” And little puff of yellow vapour would rise up and fill the air.

The walls in Dr. Boomer’s bedroom were tinged with a peculiar yellowy/brown stain, and the smell that filled the air was pungent and eye-watering. It was a smell you could never forget. 

I guess that’s why his patients never filled the second or third part of their prescriptions… or even came back at all.
