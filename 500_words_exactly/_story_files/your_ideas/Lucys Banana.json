      "story": "Yesterday morning, I woke up super-duper hungry. I ran to the kitchen in my favorite bunny slippers—hop, hop, hop—and my tummy made funny sounds like growling monsters.\n\n\"Mom! I'm super hungry!\" I said, making my eyes really big because Mom always laughs when I do that. Mom smiled and handed me a banana. It was the brightest, yellowest banana ever, just like the sun, but shaped like a smiley face.\n\n\"Thank you, Mommy!\" I said. I named my banana Mr. Squishy, because bananas feel squishy, especially when you squeeze them a tiny bit.\n\nI took Mr. Squishy to my room, and we had a tea party with my dolls, Bella and Lulu. Mr. Squishy sat in a pink plastic chair. \"Would you like some tea, Mr. Squishy?\" I asked politely.\n\nBananas don't talk, but I pretended he said yes. So, I poured pretend tea. Then I remembered bananas don't have mouths! \"Silly Mr. Squishy,\" I giggled. \"You can't drink tea!\"\n\nAfter tea, I decided Mr. Squishy needed clothes. Bananas don't have clothes, and that's funny. I wrapped him in my doll's sparkly scarf and put my toy glasses on him. He looked very important and very smart.\n\n\"Time for school, Mr. Squishy!\" I said. We played school, and I taught him the ABCs, but bananas can't read. They can't even hold pencils. Bananas are silly students.\n\nThen my brother Max came in. He's eight and he thinks he's very smart. \"Lucy, you're talking to a banana!\" he laughed.\n\n\"His name is Mr. Squishy!\" I said. But Max kept laughing, so I stuck out my tongue at him. That made Max laugh even more, and then I started laughing, too, because it was kind of funny.\n\nLater, Mom called me for lunch. I brought Mr. Squishy along because he might get lonely. But then I saw that Mom had made peanut butter sandwiches, my favorite! My tummy rumbled loudly again.\n\nI looked at Mr. Squishy. \"Sorry, Mr. Squishy,\" I said, feeling a little sad. \"But I'm still hungry.\"\n\nMom peeled Mr. Squishy for me, and I ate him with my sandwich. He was sweet and yummy, and I whispered, \"Thank you, Mr. Squishy!\"\n\nMax watched me and shook his head, smiling. \"You just ate your friend,\" he said.\n\nI shrugged. Bananas are yummy friends, but also very tasty snacks. And that's why bananas are very funny.\n\n"
