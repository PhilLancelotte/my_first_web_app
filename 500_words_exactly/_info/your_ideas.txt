<h5>Do you have a wild imagination? Do you have the spark of an idea, or even a fully formed epic? Do you want to tell the world something? 

Then this might be what you are looking for.

<b>Ask a parent</b> to make sure it's OK. Tell me your name, and your age (if you want) and then write down your idea, click on 'Save it' to get a copy on your computer, if you have email on your computer, it will send the story to me so I can have a look.

I'll give it a read and I'll give it a picture then I'll put it on this website so you and your friends can see it....
....and it will be fabulous.

....alternatively, you can click the 'I want you to write it' selector and I'll give it a go.
