<h5>Do you have a wild imagination? Do you have the spark of an idea, or even a fully formed epic? Do you want to tell the world something? 

Then this might be what you are looking for.

<b>Ask a parent</b> to make sure it's OK. Tell me your name, and your age (if you want) and then write down your idea.

I'll give it a read and I'll give it a picture then I'll put it on this website so you and your friends can see it....
....and it will be fabulous.</h5>
